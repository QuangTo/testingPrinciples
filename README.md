# Agile Testing Principles

## General 

### Quality is everyone's responsibility
Quality in testing is everyone’s responsibility. We need to break free of associating team members with a particular thing. We need to stop thinking in terms of “Dev Complete” and “Test Complete”. There is one team, and together that team can build in quality. Build in quality everywhere and every time that you can. Break down barriers, facilitate healthy relationships, and encourage communication. Be agile and make a mindset of quality the norm for your team.

### Zero known bugs approach
A Zero Known Bug Policy is simple concept. All bugs take priority over all new feature development or improvements. That’s it. There is nothing more.
An important corollary of this approach is that there is no such thing as bug priority, critical bugs, or minor bugs. An issue is either a bug or it isn’t. And if it is a bug, you need to fix it before doing other work.

Zero Known Bug does not mean bug-free code production; it means striving to eradicate all known bugs. <br/>

It is impossible for people to continuously produce bug-free, production ready code. Bugs will always
exist. The issue should be known and	by labels like:

  Critical Issues : fix immediately <br/>
  Bugs : finish current work and fix bugs <br/>
  Features : work in backlog priority order <br/>
  Improvements : work in backlog priority order <br/>

### Shifting Left, Shifting Right
The idea of this is: if an issue is discovered on production after you go live it is a very expensive problem. If an issue is found before deploying on production, it can take a lot of effort to reproduce, fix but it’s still a expensive. If an issue is known before merging code (review stage), it is cheaper but it still required a bit of effort to work. If problem can be detected on local, discussion, or cross-test that is always cheapest than other. <br/>
