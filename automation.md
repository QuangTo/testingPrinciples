# Automation Principles

### Mitigate risk, increasse confident by prevent future bugs
By cover existing/ stable features including API & UI, we can increase confident every single time dev team deploy new code/changes and release features. QA team collaborate with other team, aware of change, alertto team if needed, update test faluire and test any issue on this stage. 

### Reduce manual effort
Good test cases, good coverage on low level ( integration ) or on top level like system test can reduce 80% manual testing effort. Imagine we need to release every sprint. Effort for regression test and features test are huge. Sometime ppl make misstake to test logic issue. Automated is a way to record to right testing way, make sure data flow is work smothly from API to UI for user.

### Easy to manage case through test data


### Easy to write, run and maintain
