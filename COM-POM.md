COM: Components Object Model 
POM: Page Object Model

The Page Object Model (POM) and Component Object Model (COM) are both design patterns commonly used in test automation. They serve similar goals in organizing code for better reusability, maintainability, and readability but differ in terms of how they structure and manage UI elements.

# Comparison: Page Object Model (POM) vs. Component Object Model (COM)

| Aspect               | Page Object Model (POM)                                                                                     | Component Object Model (COM)                                                                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**        | Each page in the application is represented by a single class (e.g., `LoginPage`, `DashboardPage`).         | Each UI component (or section) on a page is represented as an individual class (e.g., `LoginComponent`, `HeaderComponent`). |
| **Scope of Objects** | Pages act as containers for all elements and methods needed for a specific page.                            | Components represent individual sections of a page, each with its own locators and methods. Pages are composed of multiple components. |
| **Reusability**      | Elements are only reusable within the page they are defined on.                                             | Components are modular and reusable across different pages (e.g., a `HeaderComponent` that is shared across all pages).     |
| **Granularity**      | Coarse-grained, focusing on the entire page.                                                                | Fine-grained, focusing on specific UI sections or components within pages.                                                  |
| **Maintainability**  | Changes on a page may affect the entire `Page` class, requiring updates to all elements in the page class.  | Changes to individual components only affect that specific component, not the entire page class.                            |
| **Usage Complexity** | Simpler to implement initially, as each page is represented by a single class.                              | Adds complexity in setting up multiple components and assembling them, but increases maintainability.                       |
| **Best Use Case**    | Best suited for simpler applications with pages that donâ€™t have many reusable components.                   | Ideal for complex applications with shared components across multiple pages (e.g., navigation bars, footers).                |

## Summary

- **Page Object Model (POM)** is ideal for smaller applications with unique page layouts and minimal component reuse.
- **Component Object Model (COM)** is suited to complex applications where UI elements are reused across pages, allowing for modularity and better maintainability.
